## Rewrite of Nwagyu website

This was originally a rewrite of the [Nwagyu website](https://nwagyu.com) using
[VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), that was expanded a lot.

Since the original website was not longer accessible, I decided to rewrite it
using VuePress so that it can be hosted on GitHub Pages and be available to
everyone.

I reused the original websiteâ€™s content sometimes, but I also added a lot of new
content.
