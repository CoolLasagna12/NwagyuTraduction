# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

## Can I install multiple apps at the same time?

Yes! You can install as many apps as you want at the same time. Just select all
the apps you want to install and click the "Install" button.

## Can I break my calculator?

No. If you mess up the installation procedure, you can always reset your
calculator by using a pencil to press the reset button on the back.

Even if you somehow manage to break your firmware, you can always reinstall it
by going to [NumWorks' website](https://my.numworks.com/devices/upgrade) and
updating your calculator.

## How to save my progress in an app?

For now, you can't. Theoretically, it's possible to save data on the
calculator's by directly editing the storage in the calculator's RAM, but it's
not very easy to do. On [Omega](https://getomega.dev/) and
[Upsilon](https://getupsilon.web.app/), it's possible, as they have a built-in
API to access the filesystem.
