# FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

## Can I install multiple apps at the same time?

Yes! You can install as many apps as you want at the same time. Just select all
the apps you want to install and click the "Install" button.

## Can I break my calculator?

No. If you mess up the installation procedure, you can always reset your
calculator by using a pencil to press the reset button on the back.

Even if you somehow manage to break your firmware, you can always reinstall it
by going to [NumWorks' website](https://my.numworks.com/devices/upgrade) and
updating your calculator.

## How to save my progress in an app?

For now, only KhiCAS and Nofrendo can. However, it might be possible in a near
future using a workaround for missing features on locked calculators. On
[Omega](https://getomega.dev/) and [Upsilon](https://getupsilon.web.app/), it's
since the start, as they have a built-in API to access the filesystem.

## Can I export my game save to my computer?

If you enable exam mode, upgrade your calculator or if the calculator simply
crash, game saves are definitively lost. So, to avoid this problem, you can
save your data to your computer to ensure it won't be lost.

If you have an N0110 or N0115 (written on the back of your calculator), it's
easy to save raw files using
[NumWorks Connector](https://yaya-cout.github.io/Numworks-connector/#/).

Nofrendo backups have the extension ".ss0".

::: warning
On N0120, most third-party tools are not supported, so don't try to backup your
files using these tools as you risk of loosing your files by resetting your
calculator instead of backing them up.
