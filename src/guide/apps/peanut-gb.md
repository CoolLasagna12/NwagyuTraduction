Peanut GB is a Gameboy emulator. Do you want to play your original Game Boy
cartridge on your NumWorks calculator? This is the app for you!

## How to get games

We can't provide you any games, because of legal reasons. However, you can
download games from the internet easily. A search like "gameboy roms" should
give you plenty of results.

You will need to add your rom as an external file. To do so, follow the
instructions in the [how to install](../help/how-to-install.md) guide.

## How to play

It’s quite obvious, given how the NumWorks’ keypad looks just like a Game Boy’s.
Anyway, here’s a list of the bindings between the NumWorks’ keypad and the
Game Boy’s:

| Game Boy   | NumWorks   |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Arrow keys | Arrow keys |
| A          | Back       |
| B          | OK         |
| Select     | Shift      |
| Start      | Backspace  |

To modify the behavior of the emulator, you can use theses keys:

| Key | Action                                           |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Use the original game boy palette                |
| 2   | Use a pure greyscale palette                     |
| 3   | Use an inverted greyscale palette                |
| +   | Render the screen in fullscreen                  |
| -   | Render the screen with the original aspect ratio |
