# Peanut GB

Peanut GB is a Gameboy emulator. Do you want to play your original Game Boy
cartridge on your NumWorks calculator? This is the app for you!

## How to get games

We can't provide you any games, because of legal reasons. However, you can
download games from the internet easily. A search like "gameboy roms" should
give you plenty of results.

You will need to add your rom as an external file. To do so, follow the
instructions in the [how to install](../help/how-to-install.md) guide.

## How to play

It’s quite obvious, given how the NumWorks’ keypad looks just like a Game Boy’s.
Anyway, here’s a list of the bindings between the NumWorks’ keypad and the
Game Boy’s:

| Game Boy          | NumWorks                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Arrow keys        | Arrow keys                             |
| A                 | Back                                   |
| B                 | OK                                     |
| Select            | Shift                                  |
| Start             | Backspace                              |
| Start (Alternate) | Alpha                                  |
| Toolbox           | Write current save to storage          |
| 0                 | Write current save to storage and exit |

To modify the behavior of the emulator, you can use theses keys:

| Key | Action                                           |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | Use the original game boy palette                |
| 2   | Use a pure greyscale palette                     |
| 3   | Use an inverted greyscale palette                |
| 3   | Use Peanut-GB original palette                   |
| +   | Render the screen in fullscreen stretched        |
| ×   | Render the screen in fullscreen with ratio       |
| -   | Render the screen with the original aspect ratio |

## Download

You can download the Peanut-GB app from this link:

- [Peanut-GB v1.1.0](https://yaya-cout.github.io/Nwagyu/assets/apps/peanutgb-1.1.0.nwa)
- [Peanut-GB v1.0.0](https://yaya-cout.github.io/Nwagyu/assets/apps/peanutgb-1.0.0.nwa)
- [Peanut-GB (Color)](https://yaya-cout.github.io/Nwagyu/assets/apps/peanutgbc.nwa)

::: warning
Peanut-GB (Color) require more RAM and use more CPU time, so some games won't
work at all or will not work in realtime (e.g. 2 second in the real world will
last 1 second in the game).
Most Gameboy Color games can run on normal Peanut-GB in greyscale for better
performance.

::: tip
At the time, only Peanut-GB v1.1.0 support games saves, so you won't be able to
save you game on Peanut-GB (Color) for now.
