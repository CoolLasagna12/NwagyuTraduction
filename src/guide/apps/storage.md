# Storage

This simple app let you check remaining Python storage on your calculator. It
show Used and Free data, the total space, a percentage of used space / total
space and the guessed model (if wrong, it will crash, and if unknown, it will
act as if the calculator is an N0120).

It's mostly a demo of NumWorks Extapp Storage library which can be included in
others app to use the storage on Epsilon's External Apps.
This library exists because there is no way to access the filesystem from
external app using NumWorks' API.
