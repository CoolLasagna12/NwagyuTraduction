- title: Use external apps on a locked calculator
  details: If your calculator is locked, you can still use external apps using
           Epsilon's built-in app launcher. No need to unlock your calculator! The
           biggest limitation is that you can't save your work
- title: Use KhiCAS
  details: KhiCAS is a CAS (Computer Algebra System) that can be used to solve
           equations, simplify expressions, and much more. It is based on the popular
           Giac/Xcas engine. With it, you will be able to do much more than with the
           built-in functions of your calculator
- title: Use exclusive features
  details: With Nwagyu, you can use exclusive features such a video player or an
            image viewer. You can also use the Lua scripting language to create
            your own programs
